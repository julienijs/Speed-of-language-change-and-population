# Speed of language change and population
## About the project
This repository contains the script and datasets accompanying the presentation [Nijs 2022](https://kzm.be/programma-herfstvergadering-2022-15-oktober-2022-9-45-kantl-gent/) and article about the impact of population size on the speed of language change.

There exists a correlation between the demographic structure of the speech community and a language’s morphosyntactic structure. Bigger languages in high-contact communities have been found to be morphologically less complex and more reliant on lexical strategies and word order compared to smaller languages in close-knit communities (Lupyan & Dale 2010). This can be explained by the proportion of L2-speakers. Complex morphology is harder to acquire for adults, so a high proportion of L2-speakers leads to morphological simplification (Dale & Lupyan 2012). Since differences in morphosyntactic complexity are the result of diachronic processes, the propagation of these processes should occur more rapidly in more densely populated areas. The idea is that the propagation of language change will be faster in cities with a larger population compared to cities with a smaller population, since the growth of cities is often due to immigration, rather than natural growth, yielding an influx of L2-learners, with knock-on effects on the speech of the indigenous population. Furthermore, city life with its many ‘weak ties’ (Milroy & Milroy 1985) is conducive to linguistic change. 

## Data & code
This project incorporates three datasets: 

- C-CLAMP corpus
- dataset with population sizes of cities in Belgium and the Netherlands in the 19th and 20th century
